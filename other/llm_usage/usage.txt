data <- read.csv("usa_00001.csv")

doctoral_data <- data %>%

```

```{r}

# Extract the number of doctoral degree holders in California
california_doctoral <- doctoral_data %>% 
  filter(STATEICP == 71) %>% 
  pull(doctoral_count)

california_total_respondents <- 391171

# Calculate the ratio of doctoral degrees to total respondents in California
california_ratio <- california_doctoral / california_total_respondents

# Apply the ratio to estimate total number of respondents in each state
estimated_data <- doctoral_data %>%
  mutate(estimated_total_respondents = doctoral_count / california_ratio)

estimated_data %>% select(-doctoral_count) %>%
  kable(format = "simple", col.names = c('STATEICP',  'estimated_total_respondents'))
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-3
#| tbl-cap: "Number of Actual Total Respondents and the Difference in Each State"


#To get the total number of respondents per state
state_totals <- data %>%
  group_by(STATEICP) %>%
  summarize(total_count_respondents = n())


# Join datasets
state_counts <- estimated_data %>%
  inner_join(state_totals, by = "STATEICP")

state_counts <- state_counts %>%
  mutate(difference = total_count_respondents - estimated_total_respondents)

state_counts %>% select(-doctoral_count) %>%
  kable(format = "simple", col.names = c('STATEICP', 'estimated_total_respondents', 'total_count_respondents', 'difference'))
```

After I done the above steps, I managed to create a table including columns named STATEICP, estimated_total_respondents, total_count_respondents and difference in the table.
Now, I wish to obtain another table indicating the summary statistics of estimated_total_respondents, total_count_respondents and difference respectively.
How can I achieve this?

ChatGPT
You can obtain the summary statistics for the columns `estimated_total_respondents`, `total_count_respondents`, and `difference` by using the `summary()` function or `dplyr` functions like `summarize()`. Here's how you can add this step to your analysis:

### Code to Get Summary Statistics

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-4
#| tbl-cap: "Summary Statistics of Estimated Total Respondents, Actual Total Respondents, and Difference"

# Summary statistics for the three columns
summary_stats <- state_counts %>%
  summarize(
    estimated_total_respondents_mean = mean(estimated_total_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    estimated_total_respondents_sd = sd(estimated_total_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    estimated_total_respondents_min = min(estimated_total_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    estimated_total_respondents_max = max(estimated_total_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    
    total_count_respondents_mean = mean(total_count_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_count_respondents_sd = sd(total_count_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_count_respondents_min = min(total_count_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_count_respondents_max = max(total_count_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    
    difference_mean = mean(difference, na.rm = TRUE),
    difference_sd = sd(difference, na.rm = TRUE),
    difference_min = min(difference, na.rm = TRUE),
    difference_max = max(difference, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

summary_stats %>%
  kable(format = "simple", col.names = c('Statistic', 'Estimated Respondents', 'Actual Respondents', 'Difference'))
```

### Explanation:
- **`summarize()`**: This function is used to compute summary statistics for each of the columns.
  - For each column (`estimated_total_respondents`, `total_count_respondents`, and `difference`), we calculate:
    - **mean**: The average value.
    - **sd**: The standard deviation.
    - **min**: The minimum value.
    - **max**: The maximum value.
- **`na.rm = TRUE`**: This argument removes any missing values (`NA`) from the calculations.
- **`kable()`**: The `kable()` function is used to display the summary statistics in a simple table format.

### Output:
This will create a table displaying the summary statistics for each of the three variables (`estimated_total_respondents`, `total_count_respondents`, and `difference`). The table will include the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each column.

错误于dimnames(x) <- dn: 'dimnames'的长度[2]必需与陈列范围相等

ChatGPT
The error you're encountering, `错误于dimnames(x) <- dn: 'dimnames'的长度[2]必需与陈列范围相等`, occurs because there is a mismatch between the number of columns in the `summary_stats_tibble` and the number of column names you're passing to `kable()`. 

In the code I provided earlier, the `summary_stats` data frame contains multiple statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max), which results in more than three columns. But in the `kable()` call, you're only specifying three column names.

### How to Fix It:
We need to modify the table so that the column names provided to `kable()` match the number of columns in the `summary_stats_tibble`. Since the summary includes multiple statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, and max for each of the variables), we must have four columns for each statistic: one for each of the variables (`estimated_total_respondents`, `total_count_respondents`, `difference`).

Let's modify the code to ensure proper column names for each of these statistics.

### Revised Code:

```r
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-4
#| tbl-cap: "Summary Statistics of Estimated Total Respondents, Actual Total Respondents, and Difference"

# Summary statistics for the three columns
summary_stats <- state_counts %>%
  summarize(
    estimated_total_respondents_mean = mean(estimated_total_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    estimated_total_respondents_sd = sd(estimated_total_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    estimated_total_respondents_min = min(estimated_total_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    estimated_total_respondents_max = max(estimated_total_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    
    total_count_respondents_mean = mean(total_count_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_count_respondents_sd = sd(total_count_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_count_respondents_min = min(total_count_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_count_respondents_max = max(total_count_respondents, na.rm = TRUE),
    
    difference_mean = mean(difference, na.rm = TRUE),
    difference_sd = sd(difference, na.rm = TRUE),
    difference_min = min(difference, na.rm = TRUE),
    difference_max = max(difference, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Convert the summary stats to a tibble for proper column naming
summary_stats_tibble <- as_tibble(summary_stats)

# Rename columns for clearer labeling in kable
colnames(summary_stats_tibble) <- c(
  'Statistic',
  'Estimated Respondents Mean', 'Estimated Respondents SD', 'Estimated Respondents Min', 'Estimated Respondents Max',
  'Actual Respondents Mean', 'Actual Respondents SD', 'Actual Respondents Min', 'Actual Respondents Max',
  'Difference Mean', 'Difference SD', 'Difference Min', 'Difference Max'
)

# Use kable to display the summary statistics table
summary_stats_tibble %>%
  kable(format = "simple")
```

### Explanation:

1. **`colnames(summary_stats_tibble)`**: After summarizing the statistics, I manually set the column names to be more descriptive. This is necessary because the original `summary_stats` contains multiple columns for each statistic (mean, standard deviation, min, max), and you need to ensure that the column names reflect this.

2. **Updated `kable()` Call**: The `kable()` function no longer requires manually specifying `col.names`, as the column names are already set correctly.

### Output:

This will create a table that clearly shows the following summary statistics for each of the three columns (`estimated_total_respondents`, `total_count_respondents`, and `difference`):

- Mean
- Standard Deviation (SD)
- Minimum (Min)
- Maximum (Max)

How to reduce the decimal to only one number in the table by revising this code:
# Extract the number of doctoral degree holders in California
california_doctoral <- doctoral_data %>% 
  filter(STATEICP == 71) %>% 
  pull(doctoral_count)

california_total_respondents <- 391171

# Calculate the ratio of doctoral degrees to total respondents in California
california_ratio <- california_doctoral / california_total_respondents

# Apply the ratio to estimate total number of respondents in each state
estimated_data <- doctoral_data %>%
  mutate(estimated_total_respondents = doctoral_count / california_ratio)

estimated_data %>% select(-doctoral_count) %>%
  kable(format = "simple", col.names = c('STATEICP',  'estimated_total_respondents'))

To reduce the decimal places in the estimated_total_respondents column to just one, you can use the round() function within your mutate() statement. Here is the modified code:

r
# Extract the number of doctoral degree holders in California
california_doctoral <- doctoral_data %>% 
  filter(STATEICP == 71) %>% 
  pull(doctoral_count)

california_total_respondents <- 391171

# Calculate the ratio of doctoral degrees to total respondents in California
california_ratio <- california_doctoral / california_total_respondents

# Apply the ratio to estimate total number of respondents in each state
estimated_data <- doctoral_data %>%
  mutate(estimated_total_respondents = round(doctoral_count / california_ratio, 1))  # Round to 1 decimal place

# Display the table
estimated_data %>% 
  select(-doctoral_count) %>% 
  kable(format = "simple", col.names = c('STATEICP', 'estimated_total_respondents'))
Key Changes:
round(doctoral_count / california_ratio, 1) ensures the results are rounded to one decimal place in the estimated_total_respondents column.
The rest of the code remains unchanged, focusing on the formatting.
